# Objectives:
Practice reading JavaScript the same way as the interpreter reads it.

After you've made your prediction, run the original code to find out if you were right! If your predictions were incorrect, look back at how the code is hoisted by the interpreter.

# Note
* Run the same code as above with ES6 syntax and compare your results:


Even if let and const prevent a lot of the confusing behavior of JavaScript's hoisting, these are ES6 constructs and a huge amount of the world's live JavaScript code is still ES5. Understanding how ES5 hoists var and the rules of scoping are important for every JavaScript developer!

* Rewrite the given code as it seen by the interpreter
* Predict the outputs
* Run the original code and compare the outputs to your predictions
