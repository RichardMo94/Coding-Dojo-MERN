# WHAT IS MERN STACK?
MERN is a user-friendly full-stack JavaScript framework ideal for building dynamic websites and applications. It is a free and open-source stack designed to supply developers with a quick and organized method for creating rapid prototypes of MERN-based web applications. One of the main benefits of the MERN stack is that a single language, JavaScript, runs on every level of the application, making it an efficient and modern approach to web development.

# Overview
As you can see we will be spending the first few days getting reacquainted with the JavaScript programming language, familiarizing ourselves with handy features of its current incarnation ES6, and learning how Object Oriented Programming works in JavaScript. Next we want to jump right into the good stuff (React). We want to prioritize the (in our opinion) trickiest part of the curriculum and familiarize ourselves with the three most important concepts of React (Components, Props, and State). Once we have those mastered we need to be able to connect our Front-End with other apps, and we will begin making requests to APIs using the Axios library. After working exclusively on the Front-End for a week, we will need to turn our attention to the Back-End. Express will be the library we use here. We will then introduce a non-relational database in MongoDB and use Mongoose.js as our ORM. At this point we are ready to go Full-MERN and will combine the React Apps we've been creating with our new-found Express and Mongoose knowledge. Socket.io then will give us a nice, easy to work with library to make real-time asynchronous communication between our server and clients. We cover deployment as well and have plenty of time to prepare for the belt exam. The belt exam is undeniably a stressful day, but if you have used your time well you can and will be successful.
